# week6-group-project

This was a group project where we all worked together to create a CRUD Ajax web page. We used crudcurd.com to create the endpoint.

This application showed different movies with times and the auditorium number. One could update the movie title/time/auditorium or create a new one. 

It was a great experience working with a group and dividing the work. We all worked together really well and helped each other when the application wasn't 
updating the way we wanted. It really was a group effort.
